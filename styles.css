PLAN: 

https://css-tricks.com/difference-between-types-of-css-variables/

Lvl 1: 
    - Existing CSS; convert multiple places where a property is used to variables (do several, including colors, sizes, etc.)
    - Add new CSS variables and apply them
Lvl 2:
    - Reset a variable within a media query (example: https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/ORdLvq?editors=0110)
    - Dark mode/light mode toggle switch for the website!! (tie css variables to function called on button click)
Lvl 3:
    - Slider to make text size larger/smaller?
    - Something using calc() or another css fn?
